## Hi, I'm Danial Mecja 👋🏻
### Computer Scientist, Explorer of experiences 🗺️

I design and develop ~~dashboards~~ interactive interfaces and tooling from scratch to **improve research workflows, analytics, and management processes** @ Khazanah Nasional.

I'm a big fan of game theory, time-series analysis, NLP, and ML Ops. I find joy in learning and exploring the underlying stories that data tells us. I love how it can say a lot about people, the intuitions that come from that, and the impact they can have in decision-making.

I'm currently making my way through: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/). 

I love doing fun things in my free time, of which include (but aren't limited to):
- Watching my favourite EPL team, Manchester United, try their best to not dissapoint me, week-in and week out 😢
- Picking heavy things up & down throughout the week, with heavier loads on the next 🏋🏻‍♀️ 🔁
- Reading on my Kindle. Check out [my goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/167109101-danial-mecja) 🤓


If you'd like to reach out to talk about any of the above or anything at all, ping me through my email below! I'd love to chat.
