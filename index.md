## Why hello there 👋🏻
My name's Danial and welcome to my personal site.


I'm a recent first-class graduate of BSc. Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) from the University of Malaya, KL. Soon, I'll be diving into the world of ✨ Data & Analytics ✨ in my country's sovereign wealth fund, to which I can imagine, will be alot of fun (pun intended).

I'm a big fan of ML (with sprinkles of DL ✨) and the insane value one can derive from it. It's easy to feel overwhelmed by the buzz in the AI space but I feel that with a goal in mind (and speaking as an optimist), there are various opportunities to leverage and build products that aid us in our day-to-day, which I'm striving to continuously work on (which I'll record in this site 🤞🏻). 

I love doing fun things in my free time, of which include (but aren't limited to):
- Watching my favourite EPL team, Manchester United, try their best to not dissapoint me, week-in and week out 😢
- Picking heavy things up and down 5-days a week, hoping they'd be lighter on the next week 🏋🏻‍♀️
- Paying meticulous attention to Ferrari and how they still struggle around 18 other high-speed cars zoom around in a circle (not a good time to be a fan of the color red...) 🏎️
- Spending many hours reading on my Kindle (check out [my book review page!](/books))

If that wasn't enough learning about me, check out my page called [About](/about.md) that's dedicated to more of that.
