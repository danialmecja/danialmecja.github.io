## Hey -- I’m Danial! 👋

I'm a recent graduate of Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence -- first class honours 💯) from the University of Malaya, KL. I'll be joining Khazanah Nasional, a sovereign wealth fund, as a Data Analyst working in the Analytics team.

I'm a big fan of ML (with sprinkles of DL ✨) and the insane value one can derive from it. It's easy to feel overwhelmed by the buzz in the AI space but I feel that with a goal in mind (and speaking as an optimist), there are various opportunities to leverage and build products that aid us in our day-to-day, which I'm striving to continuously work on (which I'll record in this site 🤞🏻). 

I'm a big fan of playing & watching football, noodling on my guitar, travelling, reading, and working out. In this site, you can learn more about me through checking out my book reviews, writings and ramblings I've had in mind, and anything else I decide to showcase to the internet ~
