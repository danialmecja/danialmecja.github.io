## Hey -- I’m Danial! 👋

I'm a recent graduate of Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence -- first class honours 💯) from the University of Malaya, KL. I'll be joining Khazanah Nasional, a sovereign wealth fund, as a Data Analyst working in the Analytics team.

I'm a big fan of ML (with sprinkles of DL ✨) and the insane value one can derive from it. It's easy to feel overwhelmed by the buzz in the AI space but I feel that with a goal in mind (and speaking as an optimist), there are various opportunities to leverage and build products that aid us in our day-to-day, which I'm striving to continuously work on (which I'll record in this site 🤞🏻). 

I'm a big fan of playing & watching football, noodling on my guitar, travelling, reading, and working out. In this site, you can learn more about me through checking out my book reviews, writings and ramblings I've had in mind, and anything else I decide to showcase to the internet ~


### What I'm currently up to:
- Picking up and putting dowm heavy things @ the gym 🏋🏻‍♀️, learning how to box 🥊, reading on my kindle 📖, and tutoring my sister 🧑🏻‍🏫.
- Working on a project close to heart (revolving around food and recommendation systems 🤫).
- Learning how to web-dev via FCC (god-sent resource).

### What I was previously up to:
- Studied Computer Science (Artifiical Intelligence) @ [Faculty of Computer Science, Universiti Malaya, KL](https://fsktm.um.edu.my/).
- Tinkered around robots and vision projects to build a [Grocer-I](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sa3yWyGbJX5OOchVpT1bDjeA35Dp8A3h/view?usp=sharing) (pronounced _grocer-eye_), a domestic service robot developed for grocery object classification and arrangement as part of my Final Year Project.
- Won the [Runners-Up title at RoboCup @ Home EDU Challenge 2023](https://um.edu.my/news/um-team-kamerider-edu-den-o-wins-the-2nd-place-at-the-robocup-home-edu-bangkok-2022) in Bangkok, Thailand.
    - Participated in the @Home challenge of RoboCup 2023 (for the first time in our university's history) where our team had to design and develop domestic service robots to complete domestic, household tasks.
    - Grinded through a 1-week period of hacking robots with functionalities that included: human-robot interaction & cooperation, navigation and mapping in dynamic environments, computer vision & object recognition under natural light conditions, and object manipulation under adaptive environments.
- Interned in the Analytics team @ [Khazanah Nasional](https://www.khazanah.com.my/) where I built Kh-AI, a Legal Domain Chatbot leveraging Google's DialogFlow.
- Became a Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) Lead for Universiti Malaya and Malaysia.
    - Led a 15-person team to organise and host collaborative, peer-to-peer workshops (Kotlin, Tensorflow) for the student-dev communit on campus, comprising of 165+ active members.
    - Co-organised [DSC KitaHack 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymaJxl2h-fg&pp=ygUMZHNjIGtpdGFoYWNr), a 2-day virtual national hackathon which hosted 20 teams of 80 students all across 🇲🇾 to develop solutions that addressed UN SDGs 🌏 using Google tech.
    - Headed a virtual design sprint workshop to 120 students from the SEA refion for the Engineering Development and Awareness Training Camp (joint effort with the Engineering Society of UM).
