Extremely ambitious of me to consider I could create and follow a habit for a mere 14 days and not even begin. I'm leaving that bit up there to hold myself accountable. 

Although I will say, journaling the past few months has helped me overcome friction at least, in the sense that I could put into writing and words, what I've been feeling the past week. 

There's this quiet shift that happens as you reread old entries. In the moment, whatever you feel seemed enormous, impossible to ignore. As days pass, the same entry looks so small, like a snapshot of my emotions at the time. Strange how something that once felt heavy enough to shape my whole week can look weightless a month later.

I think writing, apart from the pouring of thought, and reflection, reveals the scale of time. You get to see how certain worries swell when you're standing inside them, and how quickly they dwindle as you've stepped out. The way time reframes emotional magnitude and reveals that what once felt overwhelming is tiny in hindsight.

This contrast beteeen the noise of the moment and the calm reflection of hindsight is something I've to remind myself. Most things are temporary, and the time will pass anyway. Putting thoughts into words is sometimes all it takes to see them clearly.

This sounds like a whole lotta cope from someone pledging to write for 14 days consecutively. But that is me.
