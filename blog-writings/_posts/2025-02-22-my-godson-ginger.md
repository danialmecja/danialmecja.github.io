Sometime in late July 2024, my buddy, Hussein, dropped by to pass me Ginger, who arrived with quiet uncertainty. My housemates (Kishen & Mel) and I liked to think that we weren’t just housing a cat but sharing our lives with a whole person. One whose gaze was deep and unreadable, keeping us in a constant state of intrigue and suspense, always wondering what he’d do next.

Days with Ginger were never predictable. At times he was a menace, and sometimes, a cat. I never had a cat before, so I grew very attached to him.

Counting down the days of his departure to Oman, I made a calligram in the shape of him in his loafed 🍞 state, with what I’ve come to admire of Ginger’s lovingly odd mannerisms.

He was obviously never mine, not really. But he was here, and for a while, that was enough.
